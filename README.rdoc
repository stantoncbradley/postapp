Postapp

This app was developed using the Rails Api gem and basic scaffolding.
It uses Rails' built in test suite and SQLite.

Most of the app development was straightforward.
Functional controller tests can be run by calling ```rake test```

I used the closure_tree gem (https://github.com/mceachen/closure_tree) for nested comments.

Endpoints should all work as expected.


NEXT STEPS
I need to add validation methods and unit tests testing for validity to all the models.
This is straight forward and will not take long.
I need to add unit tests to my recursive comment.to_custom_hash method.
Post required custom JSON. I looked into a general solution for this but didn't have time to implement one.

While the tools a used for this example get the job done, were this a serious project I would upgrade to the following:
Postgres database
RSpec for testing
FactoryGirl for mock data generation
